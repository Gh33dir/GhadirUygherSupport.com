      Muslim Uyghurs in China have been facing genocide and are being stripped of their human rights. But why is no one talking about this? No matter the race, religion, gender, or age people are supposed to stand with eachother to prevent history from repeating itself. If we can't do anything about this, slowly more ethnicities will face genocide, and slowly the Holocaust could repeat itself.

      <p class="p2">Muslim uyghurs in China are an ethnic minority, who mostly belong in an autonomous region of China. Even though they've lived peacefully in a rural region, China has been been expanding it's detention camps in hope to suppress this minority group. China has never wanted it's population to stay strong on religion to be able to keep the government in full control. But now that there's people who stand with their beliefes, they are bound to face discrimination. </p>
